# arduino notes to makecode notes
ever wanted to use any music with micro bit?
then now you can use this script to convert arduino codes (of which are plenty midi to arduino converters online) to generate JavaScript notes for makecode micro:bit

## how to use
download convert.py and place a file with arduino codes (i.e. ard.txt) in the same folder
then run the script and it generates out.js which you can copy to makecode

## Watch out!
your file might get too large, I suggest removing parts of the song
